# GameLauncher
Very simplistic game launcher and very much WORK-IN-PROGRESS, but is functional in fetching steam games and launching them.

Finds all Steam install folders on all drives, yet to implement fetching games from drives. Currently gets games using Steam api and SteamID64. Games are selected from Games window where you select games you want and press "Add", and it adds them to the main window where you can then launch the games from.
TODO: 
- Fetch games from other launchers, for example Origin and Epic Games. 
- Visuals
