# GameLauncher
Very simplistic game launcher, very much WIP but is functional in fetching steam games and launching them.

Finds all Steam install folders on all drives, yet to implement fetching games from drives. Currently gets games using Steam api and SteamID64.
TODO: Fetch games from other launchers, for example Origin and Epic Games.
